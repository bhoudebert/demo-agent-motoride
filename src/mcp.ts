Subagents reach this same server, so the routeIds they report are valid here: compare their reports, take the best candidate and finish it as usual.

${SCOUT_SYSTEM}
Use only the agentMotoride tools (recallArea, searchRoads, calculateTrip, getWeather, reportScout), never shell commands, scripts or web search. Before answering, call reportScout once with your area, its central town, whether you found a loop, the routeId of your best loop if you routed one, and your verdict in one sentence: later sessions remember it. Then end with a short report: area, found (yes or no), routeId, distance, riding time, open-road and 50-zone shares, weather, verdict in one sentence.`;

// Server instructions reach the client's system prompt at connection time, so

const INSTRUCTIONS = `agentMotoride plans one-day motorcycle rides and keeps the rider's library of saved rides. Anything the rider says about rides, trips, loops, routes, the library, stops, cameras, weather for a ride, or a ride-day briefing is a request for this server's tools: showRide, showRideMap, listRoadbooks, listRides, rideBriefing, refreshRide, rateRide, exportGpx, exportMarkdown, planningGuide and the planning tools. Never run shell commands, scripts or web searches for these, and never look for a "ride" program: "ride show 7" or "/ride plan ..." typed by the rider means "use the ride tools" (here: showRide for ride 7). A roadbook is a saved loop or trip, with a number ("roadbook 7"; riders may also say "ride 7" for it); a ride is a roadbook on one day, named by its date ("Saturday's ride"): listRoadbooks lists the first, listRides the second, 20 per page. "Plan a ride from roadbook 7 on Saturday at 9", or "plan a ride on Saturday" once a roadbook is the one being discussed, is planRide: it adds a ride to that roadbook, never a copy; replan or edit the route only when the rider asks for a change. "Saturday was cold, 3 out of 5" rates the day: rateRide with day, which never marks a road; "never again" about a road rates the roadbook, a leg or a note. "That stretch from Ere to Hollain was great, 5" about part of a ride is rateStretch (no roadbook). "Not riding Saturday" is cancelRide; deleteRoadbook and deleteRide only when the rider asks to delete, and they ask the rider first. When the rider asks what the app can do or how to do something, call capabilities and show it. Plain words are enough, slash commands are only shortcuts: before planning any new ride asked in plain words, in any client, call planningGuide with the rider's request and follow it, with ride set when it changes a saved ride (the plan-ride and edit-ride commands already carry that guidance).
For a new leisure ride: call listSavedRides and recallArea around the start (what earlier sessions learnt: scouted areas and their verdicts, known winding roads), then ${scoutsOff ? "scout 2-4 areas with parallel subagents as planningGuide explains (API scouts are off here, scoutAreas cannot run)" : "scoutAreas with 2-4 areas"}, skipping areas recently found poor${scoutsOff ? "" : " (or searchRoads and calculateTrip yourself if scouts are unavailable)"}, pick the best candidate, then finish it: getDaylight, getWeather along the loop for the riding hours, getSpeedCameras, checkConditions (crosswind, low sun) with the date and departure, planStops with the date and departure, getTraffic for the departure. Before presenting it, call checkItinerary with its routeId, the rider's request and your text, and fix what it reports once (or say plainly which limit cannot be met). Present the itinerary in plain text (never JSON) with legs named by towns, the figures from the tools, the stops with times, the navigation links from planStops (and its overviewLink as "Whole ride (overview, not for navigation)" when there are several parts), and end with one line "Route: <routeId>". Save only when the rider asks, with saveRide; after a change to a saved roadbook, saving changes it in place and keeps the previous version (restoreRoadbook undoes it), and asCopy is only for a rider who wants a separate copy. During a ride, a remark about the road ("last 10 min awesome", "cobbles, never again") is a note: call addRideNote at once with the rider's words, and a rating 0-5 only when they gave one. After the ride, reviewRide places the notes on the recorded track (gpxPath) or on the plan, shows detours and pace, and proposes ratings; apply them with reviewRide and decisions only once the rider confirms. If the rider has a route file (GPX or KML, from another app, a club or a friend), call importRoute with its path: it returns a routeId to present, finish and save like a planned ride. If the rider shares an image (photo of a paper map, route screenshot, list of places), read the places on it in order and route them with calculateTrip by name, then finish the ride as usual. For an edit or a question about a saved ride, work from its data (showRide) without replanning. For a practical trip (commute), route point to point, motorways if permitted, with traffic.`;

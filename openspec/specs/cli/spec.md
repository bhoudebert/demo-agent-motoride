# CLI Specification

## Purpose

Plan, refine, save, view and export rides from the terminal, with the current
settings always visible and no accidental exit.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Entry points

`npm run ride` with no arguments SHALL open a menu (plan a new ride, open a roadbook from a list of 20 per page, newest first, `n` and `p` turning the pages, quit); with a request SHALL plan directly; `--roadbook <id>` (also `--ride`) without a request SHALL open the prompt on that ride; `--show <id>` SHALL display a ride without any model call.

### Requirement: Refine prompt

After an itinerary the prompt SHALL stay open for changes and questions, SHALL show the motorway state in its text, and SHALL accept commands: `/save`, `/roadbooks`, `/rides`, `/plan`, `/show`, `/rate`, `/gpx`, `/md`, `/qr`, `/share`, `/motorways on|off`, `/bike`, `/settings`, `/usage`, `/trace`, `/back`, `/quit`, `/help`. An empty line SHALL do nothing; Ctrl-D SHALL step back one level; leaving with an unsaved itinerary SHALL ask once.

#### Scenario: Back to the menu

- **WHEN** the rider types `/back` from a ride opened through the menu
- **THEN** the menu reappears and another ride can be opened

### Requirement: Settings visibility

Session start SHALL print start point, motorway state, slow-zone targets, the fast-expressway ceiling, traffic availability, model and effort, and the bike profile.

### Requirement: Library command

`npm run rides` SHALL provide help (everything, by moment, from the catalogue), roadbooks and rides, each with `--page N` (`list` only points to these two), plan, delete (roadbook or ride, confirmed), cancel, versions, restore, copy, rate-day, rate-stretch, rated, unrate-stretch, today with a day, tidy, show, export, export-md, qr, share, rate, rate-leg, refresh (with `--stops`), bike, trace, runs, delete, clear-cache.

### Requirement: Safety

Tests and scripted runs SHALL never reach the real model API with the rider's key; the CLI SHALL warn on an unknown model id and SHALL print the run id of every session for later replay.

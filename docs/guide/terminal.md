# The terminal app

The terminal app's commands, in one place; the [reference](/reference) has
the complete help texts, generated from the code. Planning uses your Anthropic
API key; the library commands (`npm run rides -- ...`) never call a model.

## Planning: `npm run ride`

```bash
npm run ride                      # start menu: plan a new ride, or open a roadbook (20 per page, n and p to turn)
npm run ride -- [options] "..."   # plan directly
```

| Option                  | Effect                                                                                       |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--from <place>`        | Start and end point: a town, a street or address, or `"lat,lon"`. Default `RIDE_HOME`        |
| `--roadbook <id\|name>` | Work on a roadbook (also `--ride`): with a request, apply it; without, open the prompt on it |
| `--show <id\|name>`     | Display a roadbook and exit, no model call                                                   |
| `--image <file>`        | Attach a photo of a map or a route screenshot (repeatable)                                   |
| `--allow-motorways`     | Permit motorways, e.g. for a commute                                                         |
| `--max-30-pct <n>`      | Target for zones of 30 km/h or less (default 3)                                              |
| `--max-50-pct <n>`      | Target for 31-50 km/h zones (default 20)                                                     |
| `--max-fast-pct <n>`    | Ceiling for fast expressways on a leisure ride (default 25; 100 turns the check off)         |
| `--allow-repeat`        | Accept rides that repeat saved ones                                                          |
| `--save-as <name>`      | Save the first itinerary under this name                                                     |
| `--once`                | Print the itinerary and exit, without the `refine>` prompt                                   |

## At the `refine>` prompt

Type a change in plain words ("too long, keep it under 180 km"), or a command:

| Command                         | Effect                                                                                                      |

| `/note <text> [--back N]`       | During the ride: a note about the last N minutes                                                            |
| `/rate <0-5> [note]`            | Rate the ride of this session                                                                               |
| `/motorways on\|off`            | Permit or forbid motorways from now on                                                                      |

Leaving with an itinerary that is not saved asks once. The conversation lives
in memory only: save the ride to pick it up later with `--roadbook`.

```bash
npm run check     # what is ready, and whether the map and weather services answer
npm run smoke     # every tool once against the live services, no model
```
